About The Project

The Recipes Project in The Odin Project's Foundations Course is the first project which aims to test the basic skills in HTML.

I have learned the following:
*   The HTML Boilerplate (HTML structure) and how easy it is to get started
*   Various HTML elements and how they are used 
*   Using Git and Github to publish my work
*   Writing good Commit messages (yet to improve)
*   Working with collaborators

This are some of the benefits I've benefited from and I'm looking forward to be a contributor to The Odin Project someday.
